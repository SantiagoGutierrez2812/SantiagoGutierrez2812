## 👨‍💻 About Me

Backend Developer specializing in the design and development of enterprise applications with Node.js, TypeScript, Express, SQL, and MongoDB. I also have experience working with React to build functional interfaces when the project requires it, while remaining primarily focused on the backend and systems architecture.

I have worked on real projects such as document management systems, PQRSD platforms for government entities, and inventory systems for private companies. I also have experience in refactoring and maintaining applications in production.

I am interested in writing clean, secure, and scalable code, applying good architectural practices, and continuing to learn technologies that allow me to add more value to each project.

- 🚀 **Current Role:** Backend Developer at [CloudCity Colombia](https://cloudcity.com.co)
- 🎯 **Experience:** 6 months | Building production applications
- 🌱 **Currently Learning:** Clean architecture, testing, API optimization, and best practices for backend in production
- 💡 **Approach:** Build stable, optimized, and well-structured systems with reasoned technical decisions.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 📑 Document Manager — CASUR
**Complete project creation from requirements gathering to production launch | Full-cycle development**

🛠️ Personal project — designed, developed, and deployed independently

I implemented CASUR’s Document Management System from scratch, including user authentication with roles and middleware, user management, and document workflows. The application allows uploading, downloading, and deleting documents, as well as opening and editing them collaboratively in real time. Documents can also be officially filed by assigning a unique record number and converting them to PDF.

**My Responsibilities:**
- 🔐 Built the authentication system with roles and middleware to secure user access.
- 👥 Developed user management features for account creation, updates, and role assignment.
- 📂 Implemented document management workflows: upload, download, delete, and collaborative editing.
- 📝 Integrated radication process, assigning unique record numbers to documents.
- 📄 Added PDF conversion via OnlyOffice API, enabling official filing and standardized storage.
- ⚙️ Configured Multer middleware for efficient file handling.
- 🚀 Deployed the system in production using Docker containers for reproducibility and scalability.

**Technical Highlights:**
- 🧩 Layered backend architecture with controllers, services, and repositories for maintainability.
- 🌐 Integration with OnlyOffice API for real-time collaborative editing and PDF conversion.
- 📦 Containerized deployment with Docker ensuring consistent environments and simplified releases.
- ⚡ Prisma ORM with MySQL for efficient database operations and schema management.

**Result:** ✅ Successfully delivered CASUR’s Document Management System, enabling secure authentication, collaborative editing, and official document filing with PDF conversion, significantly improving efficiency and usability.

### 🌱 CORNARE — Refactoring and Feature Expansion of PQRSD & DA System
**Refactoring and functional expansion of institutional PQRSD & DA platform**

⚠️ *Proprietary project — CloudCity Colombia*

Refactored and enhanced a production web application for managing PQRSD (Petitions, Complaints, Claims, Suggestions) and DA processes. The platform was modernized to improve maintainability, security, and flexibility, while adding new configuration features for the frontend.

**The Problem:**
- Repeated and redundant code across modules
- Incomplete controllers and routes pointing to nowhere
- No role-based access control implemented
- Forms without validation, leading to inconsistent data
- Frontend configuration hardcoded in backend (e.g., contact directories, names, years)

**Frontend:**
- Added new endpoints to support dynamic configuration forms (contact directories, names, years, etc.)
- Enabled frontend-driven configuration for the “About CORNARE” section, replacing backend hardcoding
- Improved form validations to ensure data integrity and user experience

**Backend:**
- Refactored controllers, services, and models to eliminate redundancy and improve separation of concerns
- Implemented role-based access control for secure user management
- Fixed incomplete routes and ensured proper request/response handling
- Enhanced SQL queries and database structure for reliability and performance

**Results:**
- ✅ Clean, maintainable architecture with proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Eliminated redundant code and improved system reliability
- ✅ Added dynamic configuration features, increasing flexibility for administrators
- ✅ Successfully deployed refactored system to production, solving critical issues in usability and maintainability

**Stack:** Angular, JavaScript, Java, Spring Boot, SQL
